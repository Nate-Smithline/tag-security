### Goals
**1. Component Independence:**
Components should not have tight dependencies on each other, allowing them to be used independently while maintaining a natural flow when used together.
**2. Primitives over Abstractions:**
Containerd should expose primitives to solve problems instead of building high-level abstractions in the API. This allows flexibility for higher-level implementations.
**3. Extensibility:**
Containerd should provide defined extension points for various components, allowing alternative implementations to be swapped. For example, it uses runc as the default runtime but supports other runtimes conforming to the OCI Runtime specification.
**4. Defaults:**
Containerd comes with default implementations for various components, chosen by maintainers. These defaults should only change if better technology emerges.
**5. Scope Clarity:**
The project scope is clearly defined, and any changes require a 100% vote from all maintainers. The whitelist approach ensures that anything not mentioned in scope is considered out of scope.

### Non-goals
**1. Component Tight Coupling:**
Components should not have tight dependencies, promoting independence.
**2. High-Level Abstractions in API:**
Avoid building high-level abstractions in the API, focus on exposing primitives.
**3. Acceptance of Additional Implementations:**
Additional implementations for core components should not be accepted into the core repository and should be developed separately.
**4. Build as a First-Class API:**
Building images is considered a higher-level feature and is out of scope.
**5. Volume Management:**
Volume management for external data is out of scope. The API supports mounts, binds, etc., allowing different volume systems to be built on top.
**6. Logging Persistence:**
Logging persistence is considered out of scope. Clients can handle and persist container STDIO as needed.

## Self-assessment use

This self-assessment is created by the Containerd team to perform an internal analysis of the project's security.  It is not intended to provide a security audit of Containerd, or function as an independent assessment or attestation of Containerd's security health.

This document serves to provide Containerd users with an initial understanding of Containerd's security, where to find existing security documentation, Containerd plans for security, and general overview of Containerd security practices, both for development of Containerd as well as security of Containerd.

This document provides the CNCF TAG-Security with an initial understanding of Containerd to assist in a joint-assessment, necessary for projects under incubation.  Taken together, this document and the joint-assessment serve as a cornerstone for if and when Containerd seeks graduation and is preparing for a security audit.

## Security functions and features

* Critical.  A listing critical security components of the project with a brief
description of their importance.  It is recommended these be used for threat modeling.
These are considered critical design elements that make the product itself secure and
are not configurable.  Projects are encouraged to track these as primary impact items
for changes to the project.
* Security Relevant.  A listing of security relevant components of the project with
  brief description.  These are considered important to enhance the overall security of
the project, such as deployment configurations, settings, etc.  These should also be
included in threat modeling.

## Project compliance

* Compliance.  List any security standards or sub-sections the project is
  already documented as meeting (PCI-DSS, COBIT, ISO, GDPR, etc.).

## Secure development practices

* Development Pipeline.  A description of the testing and assessment processes that
  the software undergoes as it is developed and built. Be sure to include specific
information such as if contributors are required to sign commits, if any container
images immutable and signed, how many reviewers before merging, any automated checks for
vulnerabilities, etc.
* Communication Channels. Reference where you document how to reach your team or
  describe in corresponding section.
  * Internal. How do team members communicate with each other?
  * Inbound. How do users or prospective users communicate with the team?
  * Outbound. How do you communicate with your users? (e.g. flibble-announce@
    mailing list)
* Ecosystem. How does your software fit into the cloud native ecosystem?  (e.g.
  Flibber is integrated with both Flocker and Noodles which covers
virtualization for 80% of cloud users. So, our small number of "users" actually
represents very wide usage across the ecosystem since every virtual instance uses
Flibber encryption by default.)

## Security issue resolution

* Responsible Disclosures Process. A outline of the project's responsible
  disclosures process should suspected security issues, incidents, or
vulnerabilities be discovered both external and internal to the project. The
outline should discuss communication methods/strategies.
